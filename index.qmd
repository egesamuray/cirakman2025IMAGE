## Welcome

This website presents our research on efficient and scalable posterior surrogate for seismic inversion via wavelet score-based generative models.

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Innovation
We introduce a novel conditional Wavelet Score-Based Generative Model (WSGM) that enables efficient posterior sampling for seismic inversion while reducing computational requirements by approximately 50% and sampling time by 73%.
